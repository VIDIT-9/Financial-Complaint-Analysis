# Financial-Complaints-Analysis

This data is a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that we sent to companies for response. Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first

The dataset comprises of Consumer Complaints on Financial products (from dec-2011 to nov-2016) and weâ€™ll see how to classify consumer complaints text into these categories: Debt collection, Consumer Loan, Mortgage, Credit card, Credit reporting, Student loan, Bank account or service, Payday loan, Money transfers, Other financial service, Prepaid card. Also we will try to identify the companies from the dataset
